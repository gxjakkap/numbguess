# numbguess

Simple CLI-based 1-100 number guessing game with true random generated number

## Why?

I just felt too bored to do nothing, and too lazy to do anything complicated. So I made this.

## Run

You can get the compiled binary file on the release page or you can run with the interpreter.

### Running with interpreter

This project use Poetry 1.2, which could be install with

`$ pip install poetry==1.2.0b1`

Then install required dependencies.

`$ poetry install`

After that, you can run

`$ poe start`

or if you want to go the easy path, just run `$ python3 main.py`

### Building from source

Assuming you already install Poetry and stuff, you can build from source with

`$ poe build`
